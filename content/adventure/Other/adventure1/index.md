We planned this as a quick 2.5-day loop — just far enough from Denver to feel removed, but short enough to fit into a long weekend.

The goal wasn’t mileage. It was good camps, reliable water, and enough elevation to make it feel earned.

### The Plan

We chose the route for a few simple reasons: steady water access, moderate elevation gain, and flexibility if the weather turned. With five people, flexibility matters more than ambition.

Day one was intentionally short. It gave us time to settle into a rhythm instead of chasing miles.

### What Worked

- Starting conservatively on day one
- Keeping shared gear minimal
- Cooking simple meals that didn’t require cleanup gymnastics
- Choosing camps slightly below the ridge line (wind was worse than forecasted)

### What I’d Change

I would start earlier on day one. We weren’t rushed, but we were closer to dark than I like when we set camp.

I’d also refine the group gear list. We had some overlap that added weight without adding comfort.

### Why It Matters

Trips like this aren’t about distance or summits. They’re small systems: route choice, weather, pacing, logistics. When those pieces align, everything feels calm.

And when they don’t, you feel it immediately.

That feedback loop is part of why I enjoy it.
