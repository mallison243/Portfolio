It was good camps, reliable water, and enough elevation to make it feel earned.\nThe Plan\r#\rWe chose the route for a few simple reasons: steady water access, moderate elevation gain, and flexibility if the weather turned. With five people, flexibility matters more than ambition.\nDay one was intentionally short. It gave us time to settle into a rhythm instead of chasing miles.\nWhat Worked\r#\rStarting conservatively on day one Keeping shared gear minimal Cooking simple meals that didn’t require cleanup gymnastics Choosing camps slightly below the ridge line (wind was worse than forecasted) What I’d Change\r#\rI would start earlier on day one. We weren’t rushed, but we were closer to dark than I like when we set camp.\nI’d also refine the group gear list. We had some overlap that added weight without adding comfort.\nWhy It Matters\r#\rTrips like this aren’t about distance or summits. They’re small systems: route choice, weather, pacing, logistics. When those pieces align, everything feels calm.\nAnd when they don’t, you feel it immediately.\nThat feedback loop is part of why I enjoy it.\n","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/adventure/adventure1/","section":"Adventure","summary":"A short shoulder-season trip that reminded me how much good planning matters.","title":"A 2.5-Day Loop in the San Juans","type":"adventure"},{"content":"A few things outside of work that keep me sharp\nColorado 14ers Hunting Other ","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/adventure/","section":"Adventure","summary":"","title":"Adventure","type":"adventure"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/backpacking/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Backpacking","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/colorado/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Colorado","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rHeading\r#\rHere are my sick projects.
